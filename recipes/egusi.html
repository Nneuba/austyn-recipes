   <h1>Egusi Soup</h1> 
   <img src="../images/Egusi-4.jpg">
   <h2>Description</h2> 
   <p>This soup is native to West Africa (Nigeria). It is a great soup
      for those who like to try something different every once in a while.</p> 
      <p>Egusi seeds give this soup a unique color and flavor. 
      If you can't find Egusi seeds, you can substitute pumpkin seeds.</p> 
      <p>Any combination of crab, shrimp and smoked fish can be used in place 
      of the shrimp. Drained, smoked oysters and chicken can be used in 
      place of the beef.</p>
